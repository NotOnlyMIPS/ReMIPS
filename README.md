# Re: MIPS

**ReMIPS** is designed as a dynamic superscalar processor implemented in MIPS architecture, providing interfaces to multiple external devices.

This project is originally for fighting the [NSCSCC 2023](http://www.nscscc.com/), but it may continue to follow up on issues such as optimization and extension.

Any reference to this repo for learning purposes is welcome.
